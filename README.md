## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Email not sending:**
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct

**Employee operations failing:**
- Verify employee IDs exist in the system
- Check database connectivity
- Ensure proper permissions

**Meeting scheduling issues:**
- Verify date format is ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
- Check if employee ID exists
- Ensure calendar system is accessible

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable `DEBUG=1` to enable verbose logging:

```bash
export DEBUG=1
```
