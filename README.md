## Integration

This MCP server is designed to work with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol. It provides a natural language interface for HR operations, allowing users to:

- "Add a new employee named Sarah Johnson with manager ID MGR002"
- "Schedule a team meeting with employee EMP003 for next Friday at 2 PM"
- "Apply for leave for employee EMP001 from August 25th to 27th"
- "Send an email to the development team about the new project launch"

## Configuration

The MCP server requires proper configuration of:
- Employee database connectivity
- Email service integration
- Calendar system integration
- Ticketing system backend

## Security Considerations

- All employee data operations should be authenticated
- Email functionality should include spam protection
- Leave applications should follow company policies
- Meeting scheduling should respect calendar permissions

## Error Handling

The server provides comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid employee IDs
- Malformed date/time formats
- Email delivery failures
- Database connectivity issues
